// =============================================================================
// selectionModel — the canonical canvas selection is a single ordered array
// (`selection`) plus an `selectionActive` flag. There is no standalone
// "focused node id": the active/keyboard-focused node is *derived* as the lead
// (last) entry of the selection, and only while the selection is activated.
//
// This makes the rendered set (selection rings + the active halo) and the moved
// set (a group drag translates `selection`) the same thing by construction — a
// node can never render as selected/active yet sit outside the moved set.
//
//   selection = []                       → nothing selected, nothing active
//   selection = [A], active = false      → A selected (ring), not active
//   selection = [A], active = true       → A selected + active (halo, keyboard)
//   selection = [A, B, C], active = false → A,B,C selected (rings), none active
//
// A multi-selection is never "activated": only operations that collapse the
// selection to a single node (click, focusNode, focusAndCenter, addNode) set
// `selectionActive`. Pure selection (marquee, selectAll, toggle, Cmd+Arrow)
// leaves it false.
