// =============================================================================
// placementForActivePanel — multi-canvas routing regression.
//
// Bug: when the active panel was a canvas, placementForActivePanel returned
// `undefined` ("default canvas placement"), and the default routes to the
// workspace's PRIMARY canvas (the first canvas tab in the center zone). With a
// SECONDARY canvas tab active, every keyboard-created panel therefore landed on
// a hidden canvas — to the user, panel creation silently stopped working.
// The fix pins the placement to the active canvas explicitly.
