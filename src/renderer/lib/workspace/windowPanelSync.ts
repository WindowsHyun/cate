// windowPanelSync — every window reports its own panels to the main process so
// the cross-window panel union (windowPanelStore) stays current. This is the
// lightweight DISCOVERY path: a flat panel list, debounced, for ALL window types
// (main, dock, panel). It is deliberately separate from the heavier dock/panel
// session-persistence syncs (dockState, terminal scrollback, canvas snapshots)
// which run on their own cadence — so discovery is event-driven and never lags
// behind a 5s persistence tick.
//
// Wired once per window from useWindowRuntime. Debounced so a burst of store
// updates collapses into a single IPC.
