// =============================================================================
// removePanelFromWindow — drop a panel (and a canvas's children) from THIS
// window. The single owner of the removal matrix:
//
//   reason 'transfer' → the panel now lives in another renderer: xterms are
//     released (PTYs keep running, mid-transfer to the other window), pi
//     sessions disposed (they're renderer-local; the receiver resumes from
//     disk), records dropped so the overview lists a panel iff it lives here.
//     The receive side re-adds everything via addPanel / applyCanvasChildPanels
//     when the panel is dropped back in.
//
//   reason 'close' → the panel is gone for good: PTYs killed, xterms and pi
//     sessions disposed, records dropped.
//
// Does NOT touch dock/canvas layout stores — callers undock the panel or
// remove its node from their own store first (detached shells own their own
// dock store, so a registry-targeted undock here would hit the wrong tree).
