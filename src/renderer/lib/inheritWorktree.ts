// inheritWorktree — when a new terminal / agent is created on a canvas via a
// generic action (⌘T, ⇧⌘A, the toolbar's terminal/agent buttons), it should open
// in the SAME worktree as the terminal/agent the user currently has selected on
// that canvas. This keeps a "new terminal" fired from inside a worktree's
// terminal in that worktree instead of snapping back to the workspace root.
//
// The worktree-aware create paths that already target a specific worktree (the
// worktree drop-up, folder drops, per-worktree context menus) pass their own
// cwd/worktreeId and don't go through here.
