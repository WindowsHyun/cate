// =============================================================================
// Agent activity coordinator: a hook-event FSM plus presence edges.
//
// Running/idle for all agents (claude/codex/cursor/pi/opencode) is driven by the
// normalized agent-hook event stream (SHELL_AGENT_HOOK_EVENT →
// noteAgentHookEvent): turn-start flips to 'running' immediately, turn-end
// flips back to 'waitingForInput' and fires the "needs input" notification,
// and session-end is treated like turn-end for state (the process may keep
// running after /clear). permission-wait (the CLI is blocked on tool approval)
// flips to 'waitingForInput' immediately with a "needs permission"
// notification whose body carries the blocked command; turn-resume (the
// approval ran the tool — also re-fired on every ordinary tool call) flips
// back to 'running' silently. The events are authoritative, so no settle
// timer is involved.
//
// Presence (noteAgentPresence, fed 1 Hz from main's activity scan) stays
// authoritative for EXISTENCE — but it is itself hook-anchored now: the
// daemon registers the agent's pid from its first hook post's lineage
// (runtime/capabilities/agentPresence.ts) and the scan reports that pid's
// liveness. Hooks can't report a crash or exit (codex never fires
// SessionEnd), so notRunning/finished still come from the scan's falling
// edge.
//
// Hook injection is best-effort, and hooks are the ONLY detection channel:
// an agent that never speaks them (codex before its native trust prompt is
// answered, a CLI launched before Cate injected the files, an unparseable
// settings file) is simply not detected — no indicator, no notifications,
// like any other process in the terminal.
