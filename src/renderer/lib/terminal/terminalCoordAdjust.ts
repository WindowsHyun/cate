// terminalCoordAdjust — decide whether the terminal's capture-phase pointer
// handler should rewrite clientX/clientY to cancel the canvas zoom.
//
// xterm.js measures cell sizes in DOM space but computes mouse offsets from
// getBoundingClientRect(), which IS affected by the canvas scale(zoom). On a
// zoomed canvas that mismatch makes text selection target the wrong cell, so
// TerminalPanel intercepts mouse events in the capture phase and divides the
// offset back into DOM space. That rewrite must be SKIPPED in three cases, or a
// middle/right-button drag-pan jumps at the start:
//
//  1. A canvas gesture (pan / edge-resize) already owns the pointer — the
//     shared `canvas-interacting` body class is set. Rewriting here feeds the
//     gesture a coordinate whose reference rect is itself moving.
//  2. A non-left press/release, or any move with a non-left button held. The
//     opening press runs before the canvas sets `canvas-interacting`, and
//     MouseEvent.button is normally 0 on follow-up moves even for a middle drag;
//     MouseEvent.buttons carries the held-button state. Leaving the whole gesture
//     raw prevents the pan origin and move coordinates from entering different
//     spaces even if the shared body class is temporarily absent.
//  3. The canvas isn't zoomed (effective ~= 1) — there is nothing to cancel.
//
// Keeping this decision as a pure function lets the middle-click-pan regression
// be locked by a fast unit test (the interplay that produces the jump — native
// capture ordering, React synthetic events, pointer-events fallthrough — is not
// reproducible in jsdom, but the guard that prevents it is).
