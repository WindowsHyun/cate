// =============================================================================
// CompanionManager — registry + connection lifecycle. LOCAL and remote hosts
// come online through the SAME path: `connect(id, transport, opts)` registers a
// DeferredCompanion synchronously (so resolve() works and the window paints
// before the daemon is online) and drives a CompanionTransport: bootstrap →
// launch → handshake → version-check → wrap in a RemoteCompanion. The LOCAL
// workspace is just `connect(LOCAL, localTransport, { install: true })`, kicked
// off at startup by `ensureLocalCompanion`. The only things that differ between
// local and remote are the `install` flag (local self-installs) and the
// auto-reconnect on a LOCAL drop — both expressed inside this one pipeline.
// `resolve` of an unknown id throws, which surfaces as a normal IPC error.
