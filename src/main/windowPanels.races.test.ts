// =============================================================================
// ORDERING RACES — cross-window panel discovery (main process).
//
// windowPanels.test.ts covers the steady-state contract; this file covers the
// orderings where IPC and window lifecycle interleave badly:
//   - a panels report landing AFTER its window closed (late in-flight IPC)
//   - a window destroyed WITHOUT a clean 'closed' event (crash-ish teardown)
//   - register → immediate destroy → report
//   - two windows closing back-to-back with reports still in flight
//   - panel migration overlap (new owner reports before old owner closes)
//   - the closing window itself being destroyed before 'closed' fires
//
// Harness replicated from windowPanels.test.ts (importing a test file would
// register its tests here), extended with a mutable `destroyed` flag so
// isDestroyed() can flip independently of the 'closed' event.
// =============================================================================
