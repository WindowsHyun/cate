// =============================================================================
// windowPanels — the cross-window panel discovery union (main process).
//
// Every window reports its own panels over WINDOW_PANELS_REPORT (a lightweight,
// event-driven list — see windowPanelSync in the renderer). This module keeps the
// latest report per window in ONE map, flattens them into a single shadow list
// (WindowPanelInfo[]), and broadcasts it to every window over WINDOW_PANELS_CHANGED
// whenever it changes. Each window projects the broadcast into windowPanelStore
// and excludes its own panels by id, so what's left is the panels that live in
// OTHER windows (surfaced by the overview + command palette).
//
// This is deliberately decoupled from the dock session-persistence sync
// (windowRegistry's setDockWindowState): it persists heavy state on its own
// cadence and no longer drives discovery, so the union never lags behind a 5s
// persistence tick.
//
// The dependency is one-directional: this module reads windowRegistry's public
// getters and subscribes to onWindowClosed; windowRegistry never imports it.
