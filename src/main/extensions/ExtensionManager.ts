// =============================================================================
// ExtensionManager — singleton registry of known extensions.
//
// Sources:
//   - sideload: local dev folders, tracked in the `extensionSideloadPaths`
//     setting. Always installed (the folder IS the root dir).
//   - catalog: entries fetched from `extensionCatalogSources`, merged + cached
//     by catalog.ts. A catalog extension is "known" once it appears in the
//     cached index; it only becomes servable (rootDir set) after its artifact
//     is downloaded + extracted by download.ts.
//
// Precedence: a sideloaded extension wins over a catalog extension with the same
// id (local dev work overrides the published artifact).
//
// Enable state lives in the `enabledExtensions` setting (an array of extension
// ids). Catalog source URLs live in `extensionCatalogSources`. Mutations go
// through settingsFile and then broadcast EXTENSIONS_CHANGED to every window so
// all UIs re-fetch the list.
